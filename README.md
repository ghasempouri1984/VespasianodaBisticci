# Letters of Vespasiano da Bisticci
The scholary edition project of Letters of Vespasiano da Bisticci [http://projects.dharc.unibo.it/vespasiano/] is part of the research activity of the Digital Humanities Advanced Research Center (/DH.arc) at the Department of Classical and Italian Philology (FICLIT) of the University of Bologna. The scientific director is Professor Francesca Tomasi, University of Bologna, Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies.
Digital edition of the Letters of Vespasiano da Bisticci, a Florentine copyist who lived in the 15th century. The letters, sent and received and up to now tracked, are navigable through a faceted system (correspondent, date, place, signature).
## Aims
The edition is accompanied by philological tools for orientation and guidance (index of the words in the form of authorities, synoptic table, philological note, description of the witnesses). 
## Scholarly objectives 
The letters are accompanied by contextual information (the collection of letters, the correspondents, the manuscripts produced by the school, the copyists of Vespasian, the libraries produced) necessary to insert the documents in a metatextual perspective.
## Mission and Target audience 
Scholars; students; general public. This edition is based on full-text transcription of original texts into electronic form. Open Access and Open Source. Part of the data underlying the digital edition is freely available for access and reuse.
## Method  
A diplomatic-interpretative transcription was carried out working, when possible, directly on the original copies (witnesses). Previous editions were also evaluated, in particular that of the last publisher, but without making a timely collation. In particular, it was based on the Cagni edition, which collects most of the letters sent and received by Vespasiano da Bisticci, and lessons and additions have been reported, both in the event of an agreement and an alternative proposal. We could detect three levels of intervention on the text, which correspond to three modalities of edition (or even to three different models of the text being coded): the conservation of graphemes and paragraph features; the conservation of graphemes and the modernization of paraphematic signs; the normalization of both graphemes and paragraph signs. Particular attention was paid to autographed documents.  The various phases of development of the Knowledge site: First, the XML/TEI P5 markup model is described. Then, the conversion process from the XML/TEI P5 documents into HTML documents is illustrated. Finally, the process of converting certain bits of information contained in the HTML documents into RDF statements is defined. A series of existing ontologies have been reused for describing the manuscript letters and the entities that contain their contextual information. 



## Spaital Humanities project
This project is an attempt to address the question “why map literature?”. The digital medium encourages a space for creativity and for experimentation with scholarly communication and methodologies; for example, an approach for cartographic comparison where maps and data layers can be visualized side-by-side for more intuitive explorations. The final goal is to provide a model for collaboration in which contributors with different technical skills can more readily contribute to a project, in an attempt to encourage a community of practice among literary experts that can essentially be adapted to other projects and their respective content.
